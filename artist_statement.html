                    I am Hao. Jack of all trades digital artist. Using my background in illustration, I reinvented myself into a multimedia digital artist. My works reflect my understanding 
                    in multiple produciton pipelines 2D and 3D and in between. My strengths lie in my ability to learn and adapt to new tools and workflows.
                    I have a full understanding of combining different workflows and digital enviroments to create collaborative works both in a production setting and personal fine art.

                    I was born in Harbin, China. My life has been a constant experience of the lack of control over my own being. Due to the combined effects from the 
                    uncontrollable circumstances, and undiagnosed autism, my higher education was delayed 10 years. Dispite showing resillience in my ability to 
                    focus on my goals, 
                    I have always felt a disconnect from the world around me. I have always felt that I was not created to be a part of this world, 
                    but an outsider looking in. Yet, I am here anyways.

                        I suppose my developtment in my artistic abilities is a reflection of my lack of control. Unable to do everything I want is unacceptable, therefore I will learn and do
                         everything. My goal in art is no longer just about creativity or expression, but a journey of understanding the world using my limited preception. 
                         To make sense of all of the confusion in my mind and the disconnection from reality. I create to put my thoughts into a narrative in hopes of finding 
                         the answers to the questions between my isolated sense of self and the world.
