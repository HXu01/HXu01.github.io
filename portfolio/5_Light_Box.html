                <p class="project_description">
                    As part of CADRE club's fall 2023 semester project, I collaborated with fellow members to produce a series of lightboxes using paper, wood, and electronics. My role encompassed designing the showcased box, as well as contributing to its assembly and wire soldering.

                    The design process involved creating a four-layered design in Illustrator, which was then laser-cut to fit within the wooden frame. LED lights positioned behind the paper were utilized to illuminate the design.
                    
                    My design concept plays with light intensity, selectively highlighting specific accents within the artwork. Also it's a cool looking gas mask.
